- Plot AQI trends over time.
- Plot Category trends over time.
- Count the number of times AQI exceeded 120.
- Identify dates when AQI reached Unhealthy.

#### Pollen Analysis
- Find the pollen type that occurs most frequently.
  
#### Comfort Evaluation (Open-ended)
- Discuss whether Nashville is comfortable to live in based on air quality and pollen data.

#### Vectorization Task
- Compare manual loop implementation versus vectorized `groupby().mean()`.
